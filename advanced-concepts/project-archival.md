When a project is completed, you can archive it. Archiving a project will remove it from the list of active projects and move it to the list of archived projects. It is a way to keep your project list clean and organized and to focus on the projects that are currently active.

Archived projects are no longer accessible for data entry or reporting, but are not deleted from the platform: you can restore them at any time.
