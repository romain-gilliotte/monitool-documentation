# Project templates

Project templates are a way to create a new project based on a predefined structure.

This can be useful when you have a standard project structure that you want to use for multiple projects, or if you want to start fresh every year.

## Creating a project template

A project template is a regular project that you have created and configured to your liking.

To create it follow the same steps as for [creating a regular project](../initial-project-configuration/README.md).

## Cloning project template

To create a new project based on a template:

- Go to the `Projects` page
- Click on `Clone Structure` in the card of the project you want to use as a template
- Click on `Configuration` in the new project card
- Update the project name and other information as needed

And that's it! You now have a new project with the same structure as the template project.

Keep in mind that invited users won't be copied from the template project, so you will need to invite them again.
