# Project templates

Project templates are a way to create a new project based on a predefined structure.

This can be useful when you have a standard project structure that you want to use for multiple projects.

## Creating a project template

A project template is a regular project that you have created and configured to your liking.

To create it follow the same steps as for [creating a regular project](../initial-project-configuration/README.md).

## Using a project template

To create a new project based on a template:

- Go to the `Projects` page
- Click on `Clone Structure` in the card of the project you want to use as a template
- Click on `Configuration` in the new project card
- Update the project name and other information as needed

And that's it! You now have a new project with the same structure as the template project.
