# Basic information

{% embed url="https://app.arcade.software/share/Vuo8H0cVDZlmhzpybpGE" %}

The basic information section of a project is where you define the general information of the project, such as the project name, the project country, the project start and end dates.

This information is used to:

- Identify the project in the platform
- As default values in other parts of the platform (e.g. in the data entry planning)
- To name the reports generated by the platform

There is no right or wrong way to fill in this information, but it is important to be consistent across projects: try to use the same format for the project name, the same country codes format, etc.
