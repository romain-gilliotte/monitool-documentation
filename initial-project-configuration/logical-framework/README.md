# Logical Framework

"Logframes" are the heart of the project. They are the place where you define the project's goals, objectives, and activities. They are also the place where you define the indicators that will be used to measure the project's progress.

You can define as many logframes as you want for a project. This allows you to have a high-level logframe that defines the project's goals and objectives, and specific logframes for donors or specific activities.

## Anatomy of a logframe

In monitool, a logframe is composed of the following elements:

- General objective, which is the highest-level goal of the project
- Specific objectives, which are the goals that need to be achieved to reach the general objective. This can also be called "purposes"
- Outputs, which are the concrete results that need to be achieved to reach the specific objectives
- Activities, which are the tasks that need to be done to reach the outputs

For each of these elements, you can define indicators that will be used to measure the progress of the project.
