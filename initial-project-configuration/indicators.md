# Indicators

An indicator is a numeric value that is calculated from the data entered into the system. Indicators are used to measure the progress of a project or program.

In Monitool, indicators are always linked to one or more data sources. This means that the data entered into the system is used to calculate the indicators. You can't create an indicator completely from scratch, you need to have data sources that provide the data needed to calculate the indicator, nor can you create an indicators that depend on other indicators.
