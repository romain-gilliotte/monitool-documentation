# Invite other users

You can invite other users to access the user-view of your project. This is useful if you have a team of people working on the project and you want them to be able to enter data, generate reports, and visualize the data.

Invited users can't access the configuration view of the project, so they can't change the structure of the project, add sites, create forms, or enter logical frameworks.

Inviting new users is done from the Configuration view of your project. You can invite as many users as you need, and you can always come back to this section to invite more users at any time in the life of your project.

Note that the email address you use to invite a user must be the same as the one they use to log in to Monitool. If they don't have an account yet, they can create one using the same email address they received the invitation on.

## Accepting an invitation

When you invite a new user, they will receive an email to inform them that they have been invited to a Monitool project. The link will take them to the Monitool login page, where they can either log in with an existing account or create a new account.
