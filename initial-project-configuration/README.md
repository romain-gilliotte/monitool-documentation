# Initial project configuration

This part of Monitool is used to define the structure of your project and is usually done by the project manager at the beginning of the project.

You won't need to come back to this part of Monitool very often, but it is important to set up your project correctly from the start.

To open the "Configuration-view" of the Gondwana project, click on the "⚙ Configuration" button on the Gondwana project card in the project selection screen. It is hidden at the right of the "▶ Open" button.
