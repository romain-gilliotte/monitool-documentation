Resist the temptation to put all the data that you need to compute your indicators in a single data source.
By doing so your risk loosing most of what makes Monitool useful:

- Track the quality and progress of data collection
- Assign data collection tasks to identified users
- Highlight data that is missing

{% endhint %}

## Definition

Data sources should represent a single source of data that is backed by actual data collection in the field.
It describe how and when data is collected to compute indicators.

As a general rule, a data source is a document or a system that contains data that is relevant to the project.

Any of the following can be a data source:

- Surveys from target population
- Reports from field staff
- Reports from a partner organization
- Health information systems
- Data from government agencies
- Data from accounting software

## Which data should I track?

It can be tempting to track all the data that you can think of, but remember that data collection is time-consuming, and is only a small part of the work that needs to be done to have reliable indicators (cleaning, analysis, etc.).

Start by tracking the **minimum amount** of data that you need to compute your indicators. If you find that you need more data, you can always add more at a later stage.

We recommend following the [recommended order](./recommended-order.md) for setting up a project in Monitool. It will help you to focus on the most important data first.
