# The Gondwana project

When you login Monitool for the first time, you will be greeted by the [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana) project. This project is a fictional project that will help you understand how Monitool works.

You can use it as to learn how to create a project, add sites, add data, and generate reports. You can also use it to test the different features of Monitool, or as a reference when you are creating your own project.

## User-view

As your first tour of Monitool, we recommend that you start by visiting the "User-view" of the Gondwana project.

This is by far the most used part of Monitool, where you will spend most of your time.

To do so simply click on the "▶ Open" button on the Gondwana project card in the project selection screen.

### General Reporting

Your first destination should be the "General Reporting" section of the Gondwana project.

This section will give you an overview of how monitoring data can be used to gain insights on a project and generate reports.

### Data Entry

You can also visit the "Data Entry" section of the Gondwana project to see how data is entered in Monitool.

Click on the "HMIS Extraction (PHC)" form in the left menu, and then load the data-entry form by selecting an entry in the data-entry planning.

This section will give you an overview of how data can be entered. You can also try to enter some data to see how it works. Note that data can also be entered using Excel files or paper forms.

### Downloads

You can then switch to the "Downloads" section of the Gondwana project to check out the logical framework and paper forms export features.

## Configuration-view

Once you are done exploring the "User-view" of the Gondwana project, you can switch to the "Configuration-view" to see how the project is set up.

This part of Monitool is used to define the structure of your project and is usually done by the project manager.

To open the "Configuration-view" of the Gondwana project, click on the "⚙ Configuration" button on the Gondwana project card in the project selection screen. It is hidden at the right of the "▶ Open" button.

### Data sources

You can start by visiting the "Data sources" section of the Gondwana project to see how data sources are set up.

A data source represent a process that generates data that you want to bring into monitool.

It can be technical, like databases, a HMIS systems, but most of the time simple things are used, like tally sheets to report the number of patients seen in a health center in a given day.

More complexity generally means more time to set up and more maintenance. Keep things simple!

### Logical Frameworks

You can then visit the "Logical Frameworks" section of the Gondwana project to see how logical frameworks are set up.

A logical framework is a tool used to design, monitor, and evaluate projects. It is a structured way of presenting the project design, objectives, and indicators.

In monitool we use the following structure:

- **General Objective**: The overall goal of the project.
- **Specific Objectives**: The intermediate goals that will help achieve the general objective.
- **Results**: The outputs of the project.
- **Activities**: The actions that will be taken to achieve the results.

You can attach indicators to each of these elements to measure the progress of the project.
