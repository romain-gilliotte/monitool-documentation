Registering is simple and free. No credit cards details needed!

## Steps

* Select "Check it out for free"
* Either
  * Register manually with an email account and password
  * Or login directly using Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 Single Sign-on

### If you choose to register with the email flow

To prevent losing  projects because of staff turn-over, we strongly recommend to only use professional email accounts, which will link your project to your NGO.

Registering with your work email will make it possible for future workers on you NGO to reclaim your Monitool workspace, in case you forgot to transfer it before the end of your contract!

### If you choose to register using Single Sign-on

{% hint style="warning" %}
Depending on their NGO tenant configuration, Microsoft users may encounter a screen preventing them to use Single Sign-on with their work account as Monitool is not a "Microsoft Verified App" yet.
{% endhint %}

As many NGOs utilize Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, and the app supports single sign-on with these services, using this feature is strongly recommended!

This feature makes it easier for users to log-in by saving them from remembering yet another password and integrating smoothly into their existing workflows.
