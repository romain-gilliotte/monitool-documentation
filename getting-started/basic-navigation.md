Welcome to Monitool!

Let's start by exploring the main features of the platform.

# Multi-lingual support

Monitool is available in English, French, and Spanish. You can change the language by clicking on the language selector in the left menu of the project selection screen.

# In-app help

Monitool has in-app help to guide you through the platform. You can access the help by hovering over the right-panel in every page.

The help will show a quick summary of the page you are on, frequently asked questions, and a link to the full documentation.

# Projects

On Monitool, we don't talk about databases, queries, dimensions, joins...

A project is a project in the sense understood in a humanitarian organization, the same as the one for which you write a proposal to your funder.

## The Gondwana project

When you login Monitool for the first time, you will be greeted by the Gondwana project. This project is a fictional project that will help you understand how Monitool works.

Learn more about the Gondwana project [here](./the-gondwana-project.md).

## Project views

A project is split into two main views: the configuration view and the user view.

In the configuration view, you can set up your project, add sites, create forms, enter logical frameworks. It's all about defining the structure of your project.

In the user view, you can enter data, generate reports, and visualize your data. It's all about using the project you have set up.
