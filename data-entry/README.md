# Data Entry

There are three ways to enter data in Monitool, depending on the context and the user's needs:

- [Using the web-forms in the platform](./online-data-entry.md) for secondary sources of data, such as data extracted from HMIS systems, databases, monthly reports or other digital sources.
- [Uploading Excel files](./excel-data-entry.md) for offline data entry or dealing with primary sources of data, such as tally sheets, individual patient records, or other raw data.
- [Uploading pictures of paper forms](./paper-form-data-entry.md) for when paper forms are still the best way to collect data.
