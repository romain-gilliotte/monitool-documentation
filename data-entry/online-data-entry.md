# Online data entry

This is the most common way to enter data in Monitool. It is useful when the person entering the data has access to the platform and internet connectivity.

The best use case for this method is for secondary sources of aggregated data, such as data extracted from HMIS systems, databases, monthly reports or other digital sources.

For instance, if you are entering data from a monthly report, you can create a form in Monitool that matches the structure of the report, and then enter the data directly in the platform.
