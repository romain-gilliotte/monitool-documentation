# Online data entry

This is the most common way to enter data in Monitool. It is useful when the person entering the data has access to the platform and internet connectivity.

The best use case for this method is for secondary sources of aggregated data, such as data extracted from HMIS systems, databases, monthly reports or other digital sources.

For instance, if you are entering data from a monthly report, you can create a form in Monitool that matches the structure of the report, and then enter the data directly in the platform.

In the `Input` section of the user-view of each project, you will find the forms that you can fill in. Click on the form you want to fill in, and you will be taken to the data entry planning.

Choose the period and location you want to enter data for, and click on `Create` or `Edit`. You will be taken to the data entry form, where you can fill in the data.

You can prefill the form with data from previous periods, or with zero values, by clicking on the appropriate button.
When you are done, click on `Save` to save the data.
