There are some things that Monitool is not, and it is important to be clear about them.

## Not a qualitative indicator management tool

Qualitative indicators are measures that describe or assess the quality of certain aspects or characteristics, often based on subjective assessment. They often answer questions like "what kind?", "why?", or "how?".

Monitool is designed to work with quantitative indicators, not qualitative ones.

If you want to track qualitative indicators, you will need to convert them into quantitative indicators. For example, if you want to track the quality of a service, you could create a quantitative indicator that measures the number of complaints received about that service, or the number of times the service was rated as "good" or "bad".

By doing that you will lose some of the nuance of the qualitative data, but will be able to mesure progress over time and compare the quality of different services.

## Not a data collection tool

Disaggregated data, such as individual patient records, are _not_ supported by Monitool.

The landscape of mobile data collection tools is vast, and Monitool is not one of them. Monitool is not designed to collect data in the field, but to analyze and report on data that has already been collected.

If you need to digitally collect data in the field, you should look into tools like [Kobo Toolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/), or other mobile data collection tools.

Integrating Monitool with a mobile data collection tool is of course possible, and encouraged using the [Excel data entry method](./data-entry/excel-data-entry.md).

## Not a beneficiary management tool

Case management tools are designed to help organizations manage their interactions with beneficiaries, clients, or customers. They are used to track the services provided to each individual.
