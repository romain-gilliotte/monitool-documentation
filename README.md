# What Is It?

Monitool is a platform to host, organize and share logical frameworks for humanitarian organizations.

Instead of being "Yet Another Form Builder v2.0 Â®", it heavily focuses on helping projects get their monitoring and data management planning right.

* Which indicators will you use?
* Do you have access to data-sources that will enable you to measure them? How often? At which level of detail?
* Once you start measuring them, which figures do you expect to find?
* How much of your operative staff time are you willing to allocate to data collection? Who is reponsible for what?
* Will the effects of your project be able to change those indicators in a reasonable timeframe?
* Which correctives actions on your project did you plan in advance for each indicator?

Those are the questions that we hope that using Monitool will help you to answer, write down in a tidy manner and share with your team and staff.

Oh, and also, we did make a form builder.
